         Looks like you wanna know A little bit more about me, so my name is Bryce Masot and I was born on November 9th 2001 which makes
         me 21 years of age as im writing this. I lived in Hesperia Califonia until I turned 5 years old. When I was four years old
         I got my first dirtbike. Soon after I moved to Riverside California until I reached 8 years of age racing dirtbikes and gathering
         sponorships. Shortly after moving to Beaumont California I have sold my dirtbikes as it was getting to expensive for my father to handle.
      </p>
      <p class="p6">
         Growing up with no dirtbikes led me to start playing video games on a pc and ive always wanted to learn how to code but didnt
         know what to code exactly. Got my first job at 16 working for a grocery store chain in my town. My daily routine consisted of grade
         school, work, and videos games, basically an average teenager's day. Being on a computer all day I got pretty good with "hacking" and being
         tech savy you can say. Years go by and not a lot has changed until i turned about 20 years old and I got a new job working for my
         grocery stores warehouse. I quickly relized that im not a very good physically labor working which I laugh at, so now im learning
         how to code and specificly full stack web developement.
