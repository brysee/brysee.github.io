      <h3>How can I make my webpage more appealing?</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>im learning more about <strong>html</strong>at the moment and I can defintely make
         this page more appealing in the future</li>
         <li><strong>css</strong>will be my next step so i can actually add some color to this bland
         page</li>
         <li>once i learn about color ways and themes I can then use <strong>javascript</strong> to add some
         animation aswell</li>
         </ul>
