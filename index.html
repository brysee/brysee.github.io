      <h3>What can I can do so far</h3>
      <div>
         <ul>
            <li>Create different sized text as you can tell by looking at my page</li>
            <li>add bullintin points which is what im using right now</li>
            <li>put images on my page so it doesnt look so boring lol</li>

      <h3>How can I make my webpage more appealing?</h3>
     <div>
      <ul>
         <li>im learning more about <strong>html</strong> at the moment and I can defintely make
         this page more appealing in the future</li>
         <li><strong>css</strong> will be my next step so I can actually add some color to this bland
         page</li>
         <li>once I learn about color ways and themes I can then use <strong>javascript</strong> to add some
         animation aswell</li>
         </ul>
